Assignments from OOP Course on Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data, week 2. https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data/supplement/AbpYj/programming-exercise-telling-a-random-story

PROJECT TITLE: "Programming Exercise: Telling a Random Story"

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use of ArrayLists to store efficiently data
                    and work with them further. Also, make use of
                    Object oriented principle of programming.
                    Assignment 1: Most Frequent Word
                    task 1: count unique words in a file;
                    task 2: output every word and its count;
                    task 3: determine the word that occurs the most 
                    often in a file. (should not consider punctuation, 
                    so “end” and “end,” will be considered different words
                    and should make all words lowercase before counting them. 
                    Thus, “This” and “this” will both be counted as the 
                    lowercase version of “this”.)
                    Assignment 2: Character Names
                    task 1: determine the characters in a file full of text 
                    (example - in one of Shakespeare’s plays)
                    task 2: count every character found number of speaking parts
                    task 3: output characters and their number of speaking
                    parts based on this number, it has to be between num1 and num2,
                    given by user.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Use BlueJ Environment to open project named "package.bluej". 
                           Find inside of this project 2 classes: 
                           WordFrequencies - compile, create object of type 
                           WordFrequencies and start function: 
                           "tester" for task 1, 2 and 3; 
                           and CharactersInPlay (assignment 2) - compile, create object of 
                           type CharactersInPlay and start function: 
                           "tester" for task 1, 2 and 3; 
                           You will be required to choose one txt example file.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: you will need 2 imports: 
                   "edu.duke.FileResource" (simplified version of File function from Java)
                   "java.util.ArrayList;"
